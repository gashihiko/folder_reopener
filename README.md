# folder_reopener
## Hotkey to reopen folders (explorer).
This program allows you to reopen the folder that you closed recently.

- Shift + Ctrl + W to reopen folder.
- Shift + Ctrl + F1 to check the folders closed recently.

**Note**: Some paths such as "Quick access", "C:\Users\User\Desktop", "C:\Users\User\Picture" cannot be reopened by this program, because the text in those folders doesn't show their full path.
